### CRISP-DM

CRISP-DM stands for [**Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining). This is an open standard created by IBM in 90ths. The following figure illustrates the different stages of this standard:

**Business Understanding:**
 - Define the goal
 - The goal has to be measurable (the goal should be based in some metric in order to evaluate success)

 **Data Understanding**
 - Analyze available data sources
 - Is the data set large enough?
 - Are the data good enough?
 - Are reliable?

Backward arrow: `Data Understanding --> Business Understanding`. By analyzing the data we may get new insights in the business goals. For example the projected goal is not well focused. Maybe we detect that with the available data the business goal is not achievable and we need to redefine the business goal. In general, what we should have in mind is that this phase may influence in the Business Understanding.

 **Data Preparation**
 This pahse consist in transforming the data in something you can put inside a ML algorithm:
 - Clean data
 - Build pipeline to transform the data
 - Convert data into tabular form
 - Feature extraction

**Modeling**
- Train diffrent models, then
- Select the best one

Backward arrow: `Modeling --> Data Preparation`. A model in evaluation may require additional features, or a different strategy to fix data issues (e.g. missing data, noisy data, etc.)

**Evaluation**
- Is the model good enough?
  - Have we achieved the business goal?
  - Do our metrics improve?
  - How much our metric has improven?

Backward arrow: `Evaluation --> Busines Understanding`. In this phase we should make a restrospective based in the output of the previous questions. And we should ask ourself:
 - Was the goal achievable?
 - Were we measuring the right thing?
 Then we should decide of we go ahead to the Deployment phase or by the contrary:
 - Go back and adjust the goal, or
 - Roll the model getting more data, or 
 - Stop working in the project

 **Deployment**
 Now days, this phase stands together with Evaluation: the real Evaluation is actually performed in _production_, with real users.
 The deployment phase should focus on the engineering of the model:
 - Monitoring the system
 - Is reliable in terms of supporting the activity/traffic of real users?
 - Does it fulfills the standards of quality, scalability and maintainability?

The wheel does not stop here, based on what we learned in the process we may improve/re-establish our business goals and start the process again. 

Also, from a DevOps perspective, the wheel does not stop here. Based on the performance and acceptance of the system, or based on monitoring data, new requirements may came up involving changes in the engineering of the system (Deployment phase) or even influence in Business Understanding.
